# zlox

ðŸ‘· _Note: this is still a WIP_ ðŸ‘·

A (currently incomplete) Zig implementation of the Lox bytecode VM as featured in [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Will be updating this repo as I complete each chapter, and with each new chapter I will create a new branch for it.

### Motivations

1. Learning how to implement a VM from scratch

- Have been interested in VMs but have never done any real grunt work on VMs - figured this would be a good way to get started.

2. Learning Zig

- Started writing Rust regularly since 2022, but realized that I've been way too out-of-touch with low-level programming.
Thought [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is probably a good way for me to get out of my high-level comfy land
